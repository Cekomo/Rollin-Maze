# Rolling Maze
 Try to escape from circular maze by rolling the ball.
 
# Developer Note
This game is special for me because it helped me to learn Unity while working on the game roughly 2 months.
I believe the outcome is worth to work on it :). For now, only Android version is available but I will add
IOS version after testing the game on Apple devices.
All the parts of the game was built by me.

# Features of the game
- 5 unique map built on blender.
- Swiping up/right/left.
- Progress saving and switching between levels. 
- Pause mechanism.
- How to play interface.
- Camera adjustment regarding condition of the ball.
- and more small features...

# Future features
I would like to build a maze algorithm that creates circular mazes automatically and transform it to blender 
or any other 3D modeling tool. This feature is crucial to build several mazes since it is time consuming.
When I make the algorithm operable, it is possible to build hundreds of mazes.

Thanks for playing Rolling Maze.
